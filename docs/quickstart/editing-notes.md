# Editing Notes

Note editing varies based on the selected tool. Ensure you are in Note Edit Mode before trying to modify notes.

## Selecting Notes

Notes can be selected by clicking on them.

To select multiple notes at once, use the pointer tool (++alt+1++) to drag a bounding box around them.

Select all notes in the current track or group with ++ctrl+a++.

Multiple notes can also be selected or deselected by clicking on them individually while holding ++ctrl++.

A continuous sequence of notes can be selected by clicking the first note, holding ++shift++, and clicking the last note.

You can also use bounding box selection with the pencil tool (++alt+2++) by double clicking (without releasing the left button after the second click) and dragging with the mouse, similar to how [new notes](creating-notes.md#pointer-tool) are added with the pointer tool.

## Modifying Notes

Notes can be moved by clicking and dragging them. If multiple notes are selected, the entire selection will be moved.

To change a note's duration, click and hold on the head or tail (left or right edge of the note) and drag to the desired length.

### Note Movement Modifiers

Modifier keys can be held to change the behavior of dragging note(s) with the mouse.

|Held Modifier|Behavior|
|---|---|
|++shift++|Vertical movement only|
|++ctrl++|Horizontal movement only|
|++ctrl+alt++|Do not snap to grid|

## Overlapping Notes

Output cannot be synthesized for notes that overlap. Overlapping notes will be disabled and will not produce any sound.

![Overlapping Notes](../img/quickstart/overlapping-notes.png)

Resize the notes so that they do not overlap, and synthesized output will be restored.

## Short Silences

The end of one note should generally meet with the start of the next note unless there is intended to be silence between them.

If there is a small gap between two notes (1/16 quarter or smaller) a `sil` (silence) indicator will be displayed.

![Overlapping Notes](../img/quickstart/sil.png)

Clicking the `sil` indicator will close the gap between the notes.

Short silences can also be removed from many notes at once via the "Modify" top menu.
